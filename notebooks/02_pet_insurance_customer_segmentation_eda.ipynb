    "# Pet Insurance Customer Segmentation - EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "The Marketing department at a leading pet insurance provider is seeking to better understand its customer base to prevent customer loss and drive additional company revenue. Data suggests that customers are most likely to cancel their policies around the 2-year point following enrollment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify 3-4 customer segments (with come justification for each) that will enable the Marketing team reduce customer shrinkage while improving outcomes related to targeted ads and/or direct-to-customer campaigns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial data suggests some key features that may be helpful for clustering include:\n",
    "* Pet species (cat or dog)\n",
    "* Amount of claims (in year 1, in year 2 and total)\n",
    "* Number of claims (in year 1, in year 2 and total)\n",
    "* Highest claim amount\n",
    "* Pet age\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Data for EDA\n",
    "During data wrangling, the PetData.csv and ClaimData.csv files were reviewed, cleaned and merged into a single dataset, merged_pets.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Questions for EDA\n",
    "The following is a list of some of the initial next steps identified for EDA based on the analysis completed during data wrangling.\n",
    "* What relationships exist between some of the key features mentioned by the marketing team?\n",
    "* Are there other features that look to be important in terms of clustering the customer base?\n",
    "* Is there a good reason to keep the Breed and EnrollPath columns?\n"

    "* **Shape** - Our clean dataframe is 50000 rows with each row corresponding to a single pet.\n",
    "* **Basic Info** - For each pet, we have some basic info including species, breed, age at time of enrollment and enroll path.\n",
    "* **Policy Info** - We also have policy-level info for each pet including the monthly premium and deductible amount for claims.\n",
    "* **Claims Data** - We also have claims data for each pet covering the first two policy years including:\n",
    "    * Number of claims per year and total (years 1 and 2 combined)\n",
    "    * Average claim amount per year and total (years 1 and 2 combined) \n",
    "    * Amount of claims per year and total (years 1 and 2 combined)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Initial Observations\n",
    "* **Species** - We have two species of pets, Cats and Dogs\n",
    "* **Breed** - We have 373 unique breeds in total (55 cat and 318 dog)\n",
    "* **Age** - The age range is between 0 (i.e., < 1 year) and 13\n",
    "* **Premium** - Premiums fall into a wide range with a few outlier values close to \\\\$1000\n",
    "* **Deductible** - Deductibles are fairly well distributed and appear to be stratified across a range of common values.\n",
    "* **Claims** \n",
    "    * For cats and dogs, the median value for total number and total amount of claims is 0.\n",
