## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <a id='overview'></a>

TBD


## DATASETS <a id ='data'></a>

The underlying source data for the project consists of two files - `PetData.csv` and `ClaimData.csv` obtained from a national pet insurance provider. The PetData file contains data for 50000 unique pets who enrolled for policies during the 2018 calendar year. The pet data includes 8 features which provide information about the type of pet (e.g., species, breed, age) and the cost of the policy (i.e., premium and deductible). The claim data includes 4 features detailing insurance claims recorded over a 3-year period between 2018 and 2020 providing the claim date and amount. The two datasets are linked by a common feature, PetId, which can be used to understand the claims totals for each individual pet.
